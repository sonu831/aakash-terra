  - Secure AWS service access via VPC endpoints
  - Traffic monitoring through flow logs
  - Defense in depth with security groups and NACLs

### ECR Management
- **Lifecycle Policies**
  - Cost optimization through image cleanup
  - Better resource management
  - Compliance with security standards
  - Automated maintenance

- **Security Features**
  - Vulnerability scanning for container images
  - Access control through repository policies
  - Encryption for data at rest
  - Audit logging for access tracking

### IAM Best Practices
- **Least Privilege**
  - Minimized attack surface
  - Better security posture
  - Easier access management
  - Improved auditability

- **Role-Based Access**
  - Service-specific permissions
  - Better separation of duties
  - Easier maintenance
